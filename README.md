# Device Failure Prediction
> Purpose of this project is to predict device failure based on the measurement of the metrics before and afer failure.<br>
>  Applied SMOTE to address unbalanced data.<br>
> Date was feature engineered. <br>
> Applied Logistic, GradientBoost and RandomForest  models.<br>
> Achieved 96% Accuracy, 95% Recall , 96% Precision, and 96 F1-score.
